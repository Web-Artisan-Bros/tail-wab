# TailWab

Tool that creates Tailwind config using Fluid Typography logic.

Inspired by [Fluid Typography](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/) and [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/),
this tool brings the same logic to Tailwind CSS by generating Tailwind configurations based on Fluid Typography.
